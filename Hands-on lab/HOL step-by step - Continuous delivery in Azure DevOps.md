# Continuous Delivery in Azure DevOps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to implement a solution with a combination of ARM templates and Azure DevOps to enable continuous delivery with several Azure PaaS services.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to implement solutions for continuous delivery with GitHub in Azure, as well create an ARM (ARM) template to provision Azure resources, create an Azure DevOps project with a GitHub repository, and configure continuous delivery with GitHub.

## Overview

Fabrikam Medical Conferences provide conference website services tailored to the medical community. Over ten years, they have built conference sites for a small conference organizer. Through word of mouth, Fabrikam Medical Conferences has become a well-known industry brand handling over 100 conferences per year and growing.

Websites for medical conferences are typically low-budget websites because the conferences usually have between 100 to 1500 attendees. At the same time, the conference owners have significant customization and change demands that require turnaround on a dime to the live sites. These changes can impact various aspects of the system from UI through to the back end, including conference registration and payment terms.

## Solution architecture

## Before the hands-on lab

You should follow all steps in the [Before the hands-on lab setup guide](Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Continuous%20delivery%20in%20Azure%20DevOps.md) *before* performing the Hands-on lab.  Pay close attention to product versions, as the version numbers called out in the lab have been tested and shown successful for the lab.

## Exercise 1: Continuous Integration

Duration: 40 minutes

After a requirements gathering effort, we find that Fabrikam Medical Conferences has many areas of potential improvement in their development workflow. Specifically, we conclude that there are a lot of manual tasks that can be automated. Automation potentially mitigates many of the recurring quality and security issues. Also, the dependencies between Fabrikam's developers' work and productivity are reduced. We will begin to address some of these efforts in this exercise to improve developer flow and establish continuous integration practices.

### Task 1: Connect Azure Board with GitHub

We can automate our project tracking with the Azure Board integration for GitHub.

1. On the GitHub Marketplace, find the [Azure Boards Integration App](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards).

    ![The Azure Boards Integration App on GitHub Marketplace that will provide a link between Azure DevOps Boards and GitHub issues.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step1.png "Azure Boards Integration App on GitHub Marketplace")

2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `Install it for Free`.

3. On the next page, select `Complete order and begin installation`.

4. Select the lab files repository created in [Task 1 of the Before the HOL Instructions](Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Continuous%20delivery%20in%20Azure%20DevOps.md#task-1-create-the-project-repo) and select `Install & Authorize`.

    ![The GitHub Application Authorization page.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step4-1.png "GitHub Application Authorization")

5. Select the Azure DevOps organization you signed into or created in the Before Hands-On Lab setup guide and select the Fabrikam project.

    ![The Azure DevOps Integration Configuration form.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step5-1.png "Azure DevOps Integration Configuration")

6. When the integration succeeds, you will be taken to the Azure DevOps Board. Follow the directions in the onboarding tutorial to create an initial Issue in the `To Do` Column and create a pull request associated with your Issue.

    ![After completion of the onboarding tutorial. Two todo confirmation messages displayed.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step6-1.png "Get started and quick tip")

7. Open the new Issue that the onboarding tutorial creates within Azure DevOps and observe the GitHub pull request and comment that are linked to the Azure DevOps board Issue.

    ![Linked GitHub items in an Azure DevOps issue in Boards.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step7-1.png "GitHub Pull Request and Comment")

8. In GitHub, browse to the `Pull Requests` tab of the lab files repository created in [Task 1 of the Before the HOL Instructions](Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Continuous%20delivery%20in%20Azure%20DevOps.md#task-1-create-the-project-repo) and open the pull request that was created in the onboarding tutorial for the Azure Boards Integration App. Note the `AB#1` annotation in the pull request comments - this annotation signals to Azure DevOps that this pull request comment should be linked to Issue #1 in Azure Boards.

    ![Pull request detail in GitHub created by onboarding tutorial in previous steps.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step8-1.png "Pull Request detail")

9. Select the `Files changed` tab within the pull request detail and observe the change to the README.md associated with this pull request. After reviewing the changes, go back to the `Conversation` tab. Select the `Merge pull request` button and confirm the following prompt to merge the pull request into the `main` branch.

    ![The file changes associated with the pull request.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step9-1.png "Pull Request Files Changed tab")

10. In Azure DevOps Boards, find the work item and observe that the issue has been moved to the `Done` column on completion of the pull request.

    ![A work item with a linked GitHub commit illustrating the link between Azure DevOps Boards and GitHub issues.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step10-1.png "Work Item with a Linked GitHub Commit")

### Task 2: Using Dependabot

We can use Dependabot to track the versions of the packages we use in our GitHub repository.

1. In your lab files GitHub repository, navigate to the `Security` tab. Select the `Enable Dependabot alerts` button.

    ![The GitHub Repository Security Overview tab.](media/hol-ex1-task2-step1-1.png "GitHub Repository Security Overview")

2. You should arrive at the `Security & analysis` blade under the `Settings` tab. Enable `Dependabot security updates`.

    > **Note**: Enabling the `Dependabot security updates` will also automatically enable `Dependency graph` and `Dependabot alerts`.

    ![The GitHub Repository Security and Analysis blade under the GitHub repository Settings tab. We enable Dependabot alerts and security updates here.](media/hol-ex1-task2-step2-1.png "GitHub Security & Analysis Settings")

3. To observe Dependabot issues, navigate to the `Security` tab and select the `View Dependabot alerts` link. You should arrive at the `Dependabot alerts` blade in the `Security` tab.

    ![GitHub Dependabot alerts in the Security tab.](media/hol-ex1-task2-step3-1.png "GitHub Dependabot alerts")

4. Sort the Dependabot alerts by `Package name`. Locate the `handlebars` vulnerability by typing `handlebars` in the search box under the `Package` dropdown menu.

    ![Summary of the `handlebars` Dependabot alert in the list of Dependabot alerts.](media/hol-ex1-task2-step4-1.png "`handlebars` Dependabot alert")

5. Select any of the `handlebars` Dependabot alert entries to see the alert detail. After reviewing the alert, select `Create Dependabot security update` and wait a few moments for GitHub to create the security update.

    ![The `handlebars` Dependabot alert detail.](media/hol-ex1-task2-step5-1.png "Dependabot alert detail")

    ![The Dependabot security update message observed when creating a Dependabot security update.](media/hol-ex1-task2-step5-2.png "Dependabot security update message")

6. In the `Pull Requests` tab, find the Dependabot security patch pull request and merge it to your main branch.

    ![List of Pull Requests.](media/hol-ex1-task2-step6-1.png "Pull Requests")

    ![The Pull Request Merge Button in the Pull Request detail.](media/hol-ex1-task2-step6-2.png "Pull Request Merge Button")

7. Pull the latest changes from your GitHub repository to your local GitHub folder.

    ```pwsh
    cd C:\Workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files  # This path may vary depending on how
                                                            # you set up your lab files repository
    git pull
    ```

### Task 3: Set up Local Infrastructure

We are going to set up the local infrastructure using Docker containers. There are three images we will be working with:

- `fabrikam-init`
- `fabrikam-api`
- `fabrikam-web`

You will need to make some edits to files before running these locally.

1. Open your local GitHub folder for your `mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files` repository.

2. Replace instances of `<yourgithubaccount>` with your GitHub account name in the following files located in the root of your lab files repository.
    - `docker-compose.init.yml`
    - `docker-compose.yml`

   > **Note**: You should replace three instances of `<yourgithubaccount>` - one instance in `docker-compose.init.yml` and two instances in `docker-compose.yml`.

3. Build and run the docker-compose YAML files edited in the previous step.

    ```pwsh
    docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.yml -f .\local.docker-compose.yml -f .\docker-compose.init.yml build
    docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.yml -f .\local.docker-compose.yml -f .\docker-compose.init.yml up
    ```

4. Verify that you can browse to <http://localhost:3000> in a browser and arrive at the Fabrikam conference website.

    ![Fabrikam Medical's Contoso conference site.](media/hol-ex1-task3-step4-1.png "Contoso conference site")

    ![The docker-compose log output observed when running `docker-compose up` on our docker-compose harness.](media/hol-ex1-task3-step4-2.png "docker-compose log output")

5. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository. From the root of the repository, execute the following:

    ```pwsh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added correct github username"
    git push
    ```

### Task 4: Build Automation with GitHub Registry

Now that we have Docker images working locally, we can now work on the automation.

1. Select the `Settings` tab from your lab files repository in GitHub.

2. Select the `Secrets - Actions` blade from the left navigation bar.

    ![The GitHub Repository Settings tab.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step2-1-new.png "GitHub Repository Settings")

3. Select the `New repository secret` button.

    ![The GitHub Repository Secrets we will create a new repository secret here used in a later step.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step3-1.png "GitHub Repository Secrets")

4. Enter the name `CR_PAT` in the `New secret` form and set the GitHub Personal Access Token we created in the Before the Hands-On Lab instructions.

    ![The New secret form where we create the `CR_PAT` secret.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step4-1.png "New secret form")

5. Select the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository, find the `Publish Docker Container` workflow and select `Configure`.

    ![The Publish Docker Container workflow that defines the series of GitHub actions used to build and push a docker container to a GitHub Container Registry.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step5-1-new.png "Publish Docker Container workflow")

6. Rename the file to `fabrikam-web.yml`.

7. Change the image name to `fabrikam-web` and the registry to `ghcr.io/${{ github.actor }}`. This is the name of the container image that will be pushed to the GitHub Container Registry.

    ```yaml
    env:
      # Use docker.io for Docker Hub if empty.
      REGISTRY: ghcr.io/${{ github.actor }}
      # github.repository as <account>/<repo>
      IMAGE_NAME: fabrikam-web
    ```

8. Add explicit path to `Dockerfile` and context path to the `Build and push Docker image` step. This step will ensure the correct `Dockerfile` file can be found.

    ```yaml
    # Build and push Docker image with Buildx (don't push on PR)
    # https://github.com/docker/build-push-action
    - name: Build and push Docker image
      id: build-and-push
      uses: docker/build-push-action@ad44023a93711e3deb337508980b4b5e9bcdc5dc
      with:
        file: ./content-web/Dockerfile                      # <-- Add these
        context: ./content-web                              # <-- two lines
        push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
        tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
        labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
    ```

9. Commit the file to the repository.

10. The GitHub Action is now running and will automatically build and push the container to GitHub registry.

    ![Summary of running Docker workflow executing in GitHub Actions tab of repository.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step10-1.png "GitHub Actions")

    ![Detail of running Docker workflow.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step10-2.png "GitHub Action Detail")

11. Set up workflows for `content-api` and `content-init` in the same manner.
    - In the `env:` section, update the **IMAGE_NAME** to `fabrikam-api` or `fabrikam-init` and set **REGISTRY** to `ghcr.io/${{ github.actor }}`.
    - In the `jobs:` section, in the `Build and push Docker image` step, set the **file** and **context** paths to the respective `content-api` or `content-init` folders.
    - Save the YAML files as `fabrikam-api.yml` and `fabrikam-init.yml`, respectively.

    > **Note**: You can optionally add `workflow_dispatch:` in the `on:` trigger section to set a manual trigger for the GitHub Actions workflow.

    > **Note**: If you encounter any errors due to `cosign`, feel free to remove the image signing section from the workflow, as it is not needed to complete the lab. You could alternatively add a manual trigger (see above) and try running the workflow again, to determine if the error is transient.

12. Navigate to the `Packages` tab in your GitHub account and verify that the container images have been built and pushed to the container registry.

    ![GitHub Packages tab listing summary of container images that have been pushed to the container registry.](media/hol-ex1-task4-step12-1.png "GitHub Packages")

13. Pull the latest changes from your GitHub repository.

## Exercise 2: Continuous Delivery

Duration: 40 minutes

The Fabrikam Medical Conferences developer workflow has been improved. We are ready to consider migrating from running on-premises to a cloud implementation to reduce maintenance costs and facilitate scaling when necessary. We will take steps to run the containerized application in the cloud as well as automate its deployment.

### Task 1: Set up Cloud Infrastructure

First, we need to set up the cloud infrastructure. We will use PowerShell scripts and the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) to set this up.

1. Open your local GitHub folder for your `mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files` repository.

2. Open the `deploy-infrastructure.ps1` PowerShell script in the `infrastructure` folder. Add a custom lowercase three-letter abbreviation for the `$studentprefix` variable on the first line.

    ```pwsh
    $studentprefix = "Your 3 letter abbreviation here"  # <-- Modify this value
    $resourcegroupName = "fabmedical-rg-" + $studentprefix
    $cosmosDBName = "fabmedical-cdb-" + $studentprefix
    $webappName = "fabmedical-web-" + $studentprefix
    $planName = "fabmedical-plan-" + $studentprefix
    $location1 = "northeurope"
    $location2 = "swedencentral"
    ```

3. Note the individual calls to the `azcli` for the following:
    - Creating a Resource Group

        ```pwsh
        # Create resource group
        az group create `
            --location $location1 `
            --name $resourcegroupName
        ```

    - Creating a CosmosDB Database

        ```pwsh
        # Create CosmosDB database
        az cosmosdb create `
            --name $cosmosDBName `
            --resource-group $resourcegroupName `
            --locations regionName=$location1 failoverPriority=0 isZoneRedundant=False `
            --locations regionName=$location2 failoverPriority=1 isZoneRedundant=False `
            --enable-multiple-write-locations `
            --kind MongoDB
        ```

    - Creating an Azure App Service Plan

        ```pwsh
        # Create Azure App Service Plan
        az appservice plan create `
            --name $planName `
            --resource-group $resourcegroupName `
            --sku S1 `
            --is-linux
        ```

    - Creating an Azure Web App

        ```pwsh
        # Create Azure Web App with NGINX container
        az webapp create `
            --resource-group $resourcegroupName `
            --plan $planName `
            --name $webappName `
            --deployment-container-image-name nginx
        ```

4. Log in to Azure using `azcli`.

    ```pwsh
    az login
    az account set --subscription <your subscription guid>
    ```

    **Note**: Your subscription plan guid is the `id` field that comes back in the response JSON. In the following example, the subscription guid is `726da029-91f0-4dc1-a728-f25664374559`.

    ```json
      {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "8f4781a5-82b9-4181-a022-4e9e91028be4",
    "id": "726da029-91f0-4dc1-a728-f25664374559",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Your Azure Subscription Name",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "8f4781a5-82b9-4181-a022-4e9e91028be4",
    "user": {
      "name": "your-name@your-domain.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
    ```

5. Run the `deploy-infrastructure.ps1` PowerShell script.

    ```pwsh
    cd ./infrastructure
    ./deploy-infrastructure.ps1
    ```

    >**Note**: Depending on your system, you may need to change the PowerShell Execution Policy. You can read more about this process [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies)

6. Browse to the Azure Portal and verify creation of the resource group, CosmosDB instance, the App Service Plan, and the Web App.

    ![Azure Resource Group containing cloud resources to which GitHub will deploy containers via the workflows defined in previous steps.](media/hol-ex2-task1-step6-1.png "Azure Resource Group")

7. Open the `seed-cosmosdb.ps1` PowerShell script in the `infrastructure` folder of your lab files GitHub repository and add the same custom lowercase three-letter abbreviation we used in step 1 for the `$studentprefix` variable on the first line. Also update the `$githubAccount` variable with your GitHub account name.

    ```pwsh
    $studentprefix = "Your 3 letter abbreviation here"
    $githubAccount = "Your github account name here"
    $resourcegroupName = "fabmedical-rg-" + $studentprefix
    $cosmosDBName = "fabmedical-cdb-" + $studentprefix
    ```

8. Observe the call to fetch the MongoDB connection string for the CosmosDB database.

    ```pwsh
    # Fetch CosmosDB Mongo connection string
    $mongodbConnectionString = `
        $(az cosmosdb keys list `
            --name $cosmosDBName `
            --resource-group $resourcegroupName `
            --type connection-strings `
            --query 'connectionStrings[0].connectionString')
    ```

9. The call to seed the CosmosDB database is using the MongoDB connection string passed as an environment variable (`MONGODB_CONNECTION`) to the `fabrikam-init` docker image we built in the previous exercise using `docker-compose`.

    ```pwsh
    # Seed CosmosDB database
    docker run -ti `
        -e MONGODB_CONNECTION="$mongodbConnectionString" `
        ghcr.io/$githubAccount/fabrikam-init:main
    ```

    >**Note**: Before you pull this image, you may need to authenticate with the GitHub Docker registry. To do this, run the following command before you execute the script. Fill the placeholder appropriately. Use your PAT when it prompts for the password.

    ```pwsh
    docker login ghcr.io -u [USERNAME]
    ```

10. Run the `seed-cosmosdb.ps1` PowerShell script. Browse to the Azure Portal and verify that the CosmosDB instance has been seeded.

    ![Azure CosmosDB contents displayed via the CosmosDB explorer in the Azure CosmosDB resource detail.](media/hol-ex2-task1-step10-1.png "Azure CosmosDB Seeded Contents")

     >**Note**: If the `seed-cosmosdb.ps1` script cannot find the `fabrikam-init` image, you may need to check the possible versions by looking at the `fabrikam-init` package page in your `mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files` repository in GitHub.

    ![fabrikam-init package details displayed in the mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files repository in GitHub.](media/hol-ex2-task1-step10-2.png "fabrikam-init package details in GitHub")

11. Below the `sessions` collection, select **Scale & Settings** (1) and **Indexing Policy** (2).

    ![Opening indexing policy for the sessions collection.](media/hol-ex2-task1-step11.png "Indexing policy configuration")

12. Create a Single Field indexing policy for the `startTime` field (1). Then, select **Save** (2).

    ![Creating an indexing policy for the startTime field.](media/hol-ex2-task1-step12.png "startTime field indexing")

13. Open the `configure-webapp.ps1` PowerShell script in the `infrastructure` folder of your lab files GitHub repository and add the custom lowercase three-letter abbreviation you have been using for the `$studentprefix` variable on the first line.

    ```pwsh
    $studentprefix = "Your 3 letter abbreviation here"
    $resourcegroupName = "fabmedical-rg-" + $studentprefix
    $cosmosDBName = "fabmedical-cdb-" + $studentprefix
    $webappName = "fabmedical-web-" + $studentprefix
    ```

14. Observe the call to configure the Azure Web App using the MongoDB connection string passed as an environment variable (`MONGODB_CONNECTION`) to the web application.

    ```pwsh
    # Configure Web App
    az webapp config appsettings set `
        --name $webappName `
        --resource-group $resourcegroupName `
        --settings MONGODB_CONNECTION=$mongodbConnectionString
    ```

15. Run the `configure-webapp.ps1` PowerShell script. Browse to the Azure Portal and verify that the environment variable `MONGODB_CONNECTION` has been added to the Azure Web Application settings.

    ![Azure Web Application settings reflecting the `MONGODB_CONNECTION` environment variable configured via PowerShell.](media/hol-ex2-task1-step15-1.png "Azure Web Application settings")

### Task 2: Deployment Automation to Azure Web App

Once the infrastructure is in place, then we can set up the automation.

1. Take the GitHub Personal Access Token you obtained in the Before the Hands-On Lab guided instruction and assign it to the `CR_PAT` environment variable in PowerShell. We will need this environment variable for the `deploy-webapp.ps1` PowerShell script, but we do not want to add it to any files that may get committed to the repository since it is a secret value.

    ```pwsh
    $env:CR_PAT="<GitHub Personal Access Token>"
    ```

2. Open the `deploy-webapp.ps1` PowerShell script in the `infrastructure` folder of your lab files GitHub repository and add the same custom lowercase three-letter abbreviation we used in step 1 for the `$studentprefix` variable on the first line and add your GitHub account name for the `$githubAccount` variable on the second line.

    ```pwsh
    $studentprefix = "Your 3 letter abbreviation here"
    $githubAccount = "Your github account name here"
    $resourcegroupName = "fabmedical-rg-" + $studentprefix
    $webappName = "fabmedical-web-" + $studentprefix
    ```

3. The call to deploy the Azure Web Application is using the `docker-compose.yml` file we modified in the previous exercise.

    ```pwsh
    # Deploy Azure Web App
    az webapp config container set `
        --docker-registry-server-password $env:CR_PAT `
        --docker-registry-server-url https://ghcr.io `
        --docker-registry-server-user $githubAccount `
        --multicontainer-config-file ./../docker-compose.yml `
        --multicontainer-config-type COMPOSE `
        --name $webappName `
        --resource-group $resourcegroupName
    ```

4. Run the `deploy-webapp.ps1` PowerShell script.

    > **Note**: Make sure to run the `deploy-webapp.ps1` script from the `infrastructure` folder

5. Browse to the Azure Portal and verify that the Azure Web Application is running by checking the `Log stream` blade of the Azure Web Application detail page.

    ![Azure Web Application Log Stream displaying the STDOUT and STDERR output of the running container.](media/hol-ex2-task2-step5-1.png "Azure Web Application Log Stream")

6. Browse to the `Overview` blade of the Azure Web Application detail page and find the web application URL. Browse to that URL to verify the deployment of the web application.

    ![The Azure Web Application Overview detail in Azure Portal.](media/hol-ex2-task2-step6-1.png "Azure Web Application Overview")

### Task 3: Branch Policies in GitHub (Optional)

In many enterprises, committing to `main` is restricted. Branch policies are used to control how code gets to `main`.

>**Note**: Branch protection rules apply to Pro, Team, and Enterprise GitHub users.

1. In your lab files GitHub repository, navigate to the `Settings` tab and select the `Branches` blade.

    ![GitHub Branch settings for the repository](media/hol-ex2-task3-step1-1.png "Branch Protection Rules")

2. Select the `Add rule` button to add a new branch protection rule for the `main` branch. Be sure to specify `main` in the branch name pattern field. Enable the following options and choose the `Create` button to create the branch protection rules:

   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging

    ![Branch protection rule creation form](media/hol-ex2-task3-step2-1.png "Create a new branch protection rule in GitHub")

3. With the branch protection rule in place, direct commits and pushes to the `main` branch will be disabled. Verify this rule by making a small change to your README.md file. Attempt to commit the change to the `main` branch in your local repository followed by a push to the remote repository.

    ```pwsh
    PS C:\Workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files> git add .

    PS C:\Workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files> git commit -m "Updating README.md"

    [main cafa839] Updating README.md

    error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files.git'
    ```

4. Create a new issue for modifying the README.md in Azure Boards

    !["New issue for updating README.md added to Azure Boards"](media/hol-ex2-task3-step4-1.png "Azure Boards")

5. Create a branch from `main` and name it `feature/update-readme`. Push the changes to the README.md to the remote repository.

    ```pwsh
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b feature/update-readme  # <- This creates the branch and checks it out
    git push --set-upstream origin feature/update-readme
    ```

    > **Note**: Because the changes had already been committed locally to the `main` branch in step 3, the changes already exist in the `feature/update-readme` branch - this is why we issue a `git push` immediately after branching from the local `main` branch.

6. Create a pull request to merge `feature/update-readme` into `main` in GitHub. Add the annotation `AB#2` in the description of the pull request to link it with the new Azure Boards issue in step 4.

    > **Note**: The `Docker` build workflow executes as part of the status checks.

7. Select the `Merge pull request` button after the build completes successfully to merge the Pull Request into `main`.

    !["Pull request for merging the feature/update-main branch into main"](media/hol-ex2-task3-step7-1.png "Create pull request")

    > **Note**: Under normal circumstances, this pull request would be reviewed by someone other than the author of the pull request. For now, use your administrator privileges to force merge of the pull request.

8. Observe in Azure Boards the Issue is appropriately linked to the GitHub comment.

    !["The Update README.md issue with the comment from the pull request created in step 6 linked"](media/hol-ex2-task3-step8-1.png "Azure Boards Issue")

## Exercise 3: Monitoring and logging in Azure

Duration: 40 minutes

Fabrikam Medical Conferences has its first website for a customer running in the cloud, but deployment is still a largely manual process, and we have no insight into the behavior of the application in the cloud.

### Task 1: Set up Application Insights

Now we want to set up Application Insights to gain some insights on how our site is being used.

1. Open the `deploy-appinsights.ps1` PowerShell script in the `infrastructure` folder of your lab files GitHub repository and add the same custom lowercase three-letter abbreviation we used in step 1 for the `$studentsuffix` variable on the first line.

    ```pwsh
    $studentsuffix = "Your 3 letter abbreviation here"
    $resourcegroupName = "fabmedical-rg-" + $studentsuffix
    $location1 = "westeurope"
    $appInsights = "fabmedicalai-" + $studentsuffix
    ```

2. Run the `deploy-appinsights.ps1` PowerShell script from a PowerShell terminal and save the `AI Instrumentation Key` specified in the output - we will need it for a later step.

    ```bash
    The installed extension 'application-insights' is in preview.
    AI Instrumentation Key="55cade0c-197e-4489-961c-51e2e6423ea2"
    ```

3. Navigate to the `./content-web` folder in your GitHub lab files repository and execute the following to install JavaScript support for Application Insights via NPM to the web application frontend.

    ```bash
    npm install applicationinsights --save
    ```

4. Modify the file `./content-web/app.js` to reflect the following to add and configure Application Insights for the web application frontend.

    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const http = require('http');
    const path = require('path');
    const request = require('request');

    const app = express();

    const appInsights = require("applicationinsights");                                  # <-- Add these lines here
    appInsights.setup("55cade0c-197e-4489-961c-51e2e6423ea2").setSendLiveMetrics(true);  # <-- Make sure AI Inst. Key matches key from step 2.
    appInsights.start();

    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist/content-web')));
    const contentApiUrl = process.env.CONTENT_API_URL || "http://localhost:3001";

    ...
    ```

5. Add and commit changes to your GitHub lab-files repository. From the root of the repository, execute the following:

    ```pwsh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added Application Insights"
    git push
    ```

6. Wait for the GitHub Actions for your lab files repository to complete before executing the next step.

7. Redeploy the web application by running the `deploy-webapp.ps1` PowerShell script from the `infrastructure` folder.

8. Visit the deployed website and check Application Insights in the Azure Portal to see instrumentation data.

### Task 2: Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions

Now that the infrastructure is in place, we can set up continuous deployment with GitHub Actions.

1. Open the `deploy-sp.ps1` PowerShell script in the `infrastructure` folder of your lab files GitHub repository and add the same custom lowercase three-letter abbreviation we used in a previous exercise for `$studentprefix` variable on the first line. Note the call to create a Service Principal.

    ```pwsh
    $studentprefix ="Your 3 letter abbreviation here"
    $resourcegroupName = "fabmedical-rg-" + $studentprefix

    $id = $(az group show `
        --name $resourcegroupName `
        --query id)

    az ad sp create-for-rbac `
        --name "fabmedical-$studentprefix" `
        --sdk-auth `
        --role contributor `
        --scopes $id
    ```

2. Execute the `deploy-sp.ps1` PowerShell script. Copy the resulting JSON output for use in the next step.

    ```pwsh
    {
        "clientId": "...",
        "clientSecret": "...",
        "subscriptionId": "...",
        "tenantId": "...",
        "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
        "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
        "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
        "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
        "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
        "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
    }
    ```

3. In your GitHub lab files repository, navigate to the `Secrets` blade in the `Settings` tag and create a new repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. Paste the JSON output copied in the previous step to the secret value and save it.

4. Add a new GitHub Action workflow in your GitHub lab files repository by selecting the `Actions` tab and selecting `New workflow`.

    ![The `New workflow` button in the repository GitHub Actions tab.](media/hol-ex3-task2-step1-1.png "GitHub Actions")

5. Select the `Set up a workflow yourself` link. Name the new YAML file `docker-publish.yml`.  

    ![The Choose a workflow options are listed and the link to set up a workflow yourself is highlighted for emphasis.](media/hol-ex3-task2-step5-1.png "GitHub Actions")

6. Change the `name` property to `Docker Compose Build and Deploy`. Modify the YAML to reflect the following.

    >**Note**: Make sure to change the student prefix for the last action in the `build` job.

    ```yaml
    # This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

    name: Docker Compose Build and Deploy

    env:
      REGISTRY: ghcr.io

    # Controls when the action will run. 
    on:
      # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
      push:
        branches: [ main ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]

      # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
      workflow_dispatch:

    # A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
    jobs:
      # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
      build:
        # The type of runner that the job will run on
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
        steps:
        # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2

        # Login against a Docker registry except on PR
        # https://github.com/docker/login-action
        - name: Log into registry ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
          if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
          uses: docker/login-action@28218f9b04b4f3f62068d7b6ce6ca5b26e35336c
          with:
            registry: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
            username: ${{ github.actor }}
            password: ${{ secrets.CR_PAT }}

        - name: Build and Push image
          run: |
            docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f build.docker-compose.yml build
            docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f build.docker-compose.yml push

        - name: Login on Azure CLI
          uses: azure/login@v1.1
          with:
            creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

        - name: Deploy WebApp
          shell: pwsh
          env:
            CR_PAT: ${{ secrets.CR_PAT }}
          run: |
            cd ./infrastructure
            ./deploy-webapp.ps1 -studentprefix hbs  # <-- This needs to
                                                    # match the student
                                                    # prefix we use in
                                                    # previous steps.
    ```

7. Commit the YAML file to your `main` branch. A GitHub action should begin to execute for the new workflow.

    >**Note**: Make sure that your Actions workflow file does not contain any syntax errors, which may appear when you copy and paste. They are highlighted in the editor or when the Action tries to run, as shown below.

    ![GitHub Actions workflow file syntax error.](media/github-actions-workflow-file-error.png "Syntax error in Actions workflow file")

8. Observe that the action builds the docker images, pushes them to the container registry, and deploys them to the Azure web application.

    ![GitHub Action detail reflecting Docker ](media/hol-ex3-task2-step8-1.png "GitHub Action detail")

9. Perform a `git pull` on your local repository folder to fetch the latest changes from GitHub.

### Task 3: Continuous Deployment with Azure DevOps Pipelines

> **Note**: This section demonstrates Continuous Deployment via ADO pipelines, which is equivalent to the Continuous Deployment via GitHub Actions demonstrated in Task 2. For this reason, disabling GitHub action here is critical so that both pipelines (ADO & GitHub Actions) don't interfere with each other.
> **Note**: To complete [Exercise 3: Task 3](#task-3-continuous-deployment-with-azure-devops-pipelines), the student will need to request a free grant of parallel jobs in Azure Pipelines via [this form](https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request). More information can be found [here regarding changes in Azure Pipelines Grant for Public Projects](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/change-in-azure-pipelines-grant-for-public-projects/)

1. Disable your GitHub Actions by adding the `branches-ignore` property to the existing workflows in your lab files repository (located under the `.github/workflows` folder).

    ```pwsh
    on:
      push:
        branches-ignore:    # <-- Add this list property
          - '**'            # <-- with '**' to disable all branches
    ```

2. Navigate to your Azure DevOps `Fabrikam` project, select the `Project Settings` blade, and open the `Service Connections` tab.

3. Create a new `Docker Registry` service connection and set the values to:

    - Docker Registry: <https://ghcr.io>
    - Docker ID: [GitHub account name]
    - Docker Password: [GitHub Personal Access Token]
    - Service connection name: GitHub Container Registry

    ![Azure DevOps Project Service Connection Configuration that establishes the credentials necessary for Azure DevOps to push to the GitHub Container Registry.](media/hol-ex3-task3-step3-1.png "Azure DevOps Project Service Connection Configuration")

4. Navigate to your Azure DevOps `Fabrikam` project, select the `Pipelines` blade, and create a new pipeline.

    ![Initial creation page for a new Azure DevOps Pipeline.](media/hol-ex3-task3-step4-1.png "Azure DevOps Pipelines")

5. In the `Connect` tab, choose the `GitHub` selection.

    ![Azure DevOps Pipeline Connections page where we associate the GitHub repository with this pipeline.](media/hol-ex3-task3-step5-1.png "Azure DevOps Pipeline Connections")

6. Select your GitHub lab files repository. Azure DevOps will redirect you to authorize yourself with GitHub. Log in and select the repository that you want to allow Azure DevOps to access.

7. In the `Configure` tab, choose the `Starter Pipeline`.

    ![Selecting the Starter pipeline on the Configure your pipeline step in Azure DevOps.](media/hol-ex3-task3-step7-1.png "Selecting the Starter pipeline")

8. Remove all the steps from the YAML. The empty pipeline should look like the following:

    ```yaml
    # Starter pipeline
    # Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
    # Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
    # https://aka.ms/yaml

    trigger:
    - main

    pool:
      vmImage: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    ```

9. In the sidebar, find the `Docker Compose` task and configure it with the following fields, then select the **Add** button:

    - Container Registry Type: Container Registry
    - Docker Registry Service Connection: GitHub Container Registry (created in step 3)
    - Docker Compose File: **/docker-compose.yml
    - Additional Docker Compose Files: build.docker-compose.yml
    - Action: Build Service Images
    - Additional Image Tags = $(Build.BuildNumber)

    ![Docker Compose Task definition in the AzureDevOps pipeline.](media/hol-ex3-task3-step9-1.png "Docker Compose Task")
    ![Docker Compose Task Values in the AzureDevOps pipeline.](media/hol-ex3-task3-step9-2.png "Docker Compose Task Values")

    >**Note**: If the sidebar doesn't appear, you may need to select `Show assistant`.

10. Repeat step 9 and add another `Docker Compose` task and configure it with the following fields:

    - Container Registry Type: Container Registry
    - Docker Registry Service Connection: GitHub Container Registry (created in step 3)
    - Docker Compose File: **/docker-compose.yml
    - Additional Docker Compose Files: build.docker-compose.yml
    - Action: Push Service Images
    - Additional Image Tags = $(Build.BuildNumber)

    >**Note**: Pay close attention to the **Action** in Step 10. This is where it differs from Step 9.

    The YAML should be:

    ```yaml
    # Starter pipeline
    # Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
    # Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
    # https://aka.ms/yaml

    trigger:
    - main

    pool:
    vmImage: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - task: DockerCompose@0
    inputs:
        containerregistrytype: 'Container Registry'
        dockerRegistryEndpoint: 'GitHub Container Registry'
        dockerComposeFile: '**/docker-compose.yml'
        additionalDockerComposeFiles: 'build.docker-compose.yml'
        action: 'Push services'
        additionalImageTags: '$(Build.BuildNumber)'
    - task: DockerCompose@0
    inputs:
        containerregistrytype: 'Container Registry'
        dockerRegistryEndpoint: 'GitHub Container Registry'
        dockerComposeFile: '**/docker-compose.yml'
        additionalDockerComposeFiles: 'build.docker-compose.yml'
        action: 'Push services'
        additionalImageTags: '$(Build.BuildNumber)'
    ```

11. Save and run the build. New docker images will be built and pushed to the GitHub package registry.

    >**Note**: You may need to grant permission for the pipeline to use the service connection before the run happens.

    ![Run detail of the Azure DevOps pipeline previously created.](media/hol-ex3-task3-step11-1.png "Build Pipeline Run detail")

    If you haven't been granted the parallelism, your job will fail with the following message:

    ```text
    ##[error]No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted. To request a free parallelism grant, please fill out the following form https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request
    ```

    Once parallelism is granted, then your pipeline can run.

12. Navigate to your `Fabrikam` project in Azure DevOps and select the `Project Settings` blade. From there, select the `Service Connections` tab.

13. Create a new `Azure Resource Manager` service connection and choose `Service Principal (automatic)`.

14. Choose your target subscription and resource group and set the `Service Connection` name to `Fabrikam-Azure`. Save the service connection - we will reference it in a later step.

15. Open the build pipeline in `Edit` mode, and then select the `Variables` button on the top-right corner of the pipeline editor. Add a secret variable `CR_PAT`, check the `Keep this value secret` checkbox, and copy the GitHub Personal Access Token from the Before the Hands-on lab guided instruction into the `Value` field. Save the pipeline variable - we will reference it in a later step.

    ![Adding a new Pipeline Variable to an existing Azure DevOps pipeline.](media/hol-ex3-task3-step15-1.png "New Pipeline Variable")

16. Modify the build pipeline YAML to split into a build stage and a deploy stage, as follows.

    >**Note**: Pay close attention to the `DeployProd` stage, as you need to add your abbreviation to the `arguments` section.

    ```yaml
    # Starter pipeline
    # Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
    # Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
    # https://aka.ms/yaml

    trigger:
    - main

    pool:
      vmImage: ubuntu-latest

    stages:
    - stage: build
      jobs:
      - job: 'BuildAndPublish'
        displayName: 'Build and Publish'
        steps:
        - task: DockerCompose@0
          inputs:
            containerregistrytype: 'Container Registry'
            dockerRegistryEndpoint: 'GitHub Container Registry'
            dockerComposeFile: '**/docker-compose.yml'
            additionalDockerComposeFiles: 'build.docker-compose.yml'
            action: 'Build services'
            additionalImageTags: '$(Build.BuildNumber)'
        - task: DockerCompose@0
          inputs:
            containerregistrytype: 'Container Registry'
            dockerRegistryEndpoint: 'GitHub Container Registry'

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 15 minutes

Now that the lab is complete, we need to tear down the Azure resources that we created.

### Task 1: Tear down Azure Resources

Now that the lab is done, we are done with our Azure resources. It is good practice to tear down the resources and avoid incurring costs for unnecessary resources.

1. Open the `teardown-infrastructure.ps1` PowerShell script in the `infrastructure` folder of your GitHub lab files repository and add the same custom lowercase three-letter abbreviation we used in a previous exercise for `$studentprefix` variable on the first line.

    ```pwsh
    $studentprefix ="Your 3 letter abbreviation here"
    $resourcegroupName = "fabmedical-rg-" + $studentprefix

    az ad sp delete --id "fabmedical-$studentprefix"
    az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
    ```

2. Execute the `teardown-infrastructure.ps1` PowerShell script to tear down the Azure resources for this lab.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
