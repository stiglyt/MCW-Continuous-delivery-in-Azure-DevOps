# Continuous Delivery in Azure DevOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

You should follow all steps in this document *before* performing the Hands-on lab. Pay close attention to product versions, as the version numbers called out in the lab have been tested and shown successful for the lab.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription will be provided for the workshop. If using your own, it must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work

      - To complete this lab setup, ensure your account includes the following:

      - Has the [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) built-in role for the subscription you use.

      - Is a [Member](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#member-and-guest-users) user in the Azure AD tenant you use. (Guest users will not have the necessary permissions.)

2. A Microsoft [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

3. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

    - A browser, preferably Chrome for consistency with the lab implementation tests.

4. [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

5. PowerShell

6. [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

7. [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)

8. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (This lab has been tested with Node.js version 16.13.0, which includes npm 8.1.0.)

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

You should follow all of the steps provided in this section _before_ taking part in the hands-on lab ahead of time.

### Task 1: Create the Project Repo

In this task, you will create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com) and use `git` to add lab files to a new repository.

1. Create a new repository in GitHub for the lab files.

    - Browse to [GitHub](https://github.com) in your browser and log into your account.

    - Create a new repository.

      - Select the `New` button.

        ![The `New Repository` button in a GitHub profile.](media/b4-task1-step1-1.png "New Repository Button")

      - Provide a name and description for your new repository.

        > **Note**: The suggested name for the repository is `mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files`.

      - Select `Private` to make this a private repository.

        ![The `New Repository` creation form in GitHub.](media/b4-task1-step1-2.png "New Repository Creation Form")

      - Select the `Create Repository` button to create the new repository. Once the repository is created, you should see the quick setup notes.

        ![The created repository in GitHub. This should reflect the repository that was created.](media/b4-task1-step1-3.png "Created Repository Page")

        > **Note:** Copy the URL for this repository, as you need it for the next step.

2. Clone the lab repository.

- Create an appropriate workspace folder and navigate to it in a PowerShell terminal.

 > **Note**: Suggested name for the workspace folder is `C:\Workspaces\lab`, for example:

 ```pwsh
 C:
 mkdir C:\Workspaces
 cd C:\Workspaces
 mkdir lab
 cd lab
 ```

- You should now be in `C:\Workspaces\lab`. Type the following command and press `<ENTER>`:

 ```pwsh
 git clone https://github.com/stiglyt/MCW-Continuous-delivery-in-Azure-DevOps.git
 ```

- Within the `lab` folder, create a folder for the GitHub repository created in Step 1 and navigate to it in PowerShell.

 ```pwsh
 mkdir mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files
 cd mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files
 ```

- You should now be in `C:\Workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files`. The lab files cloned from the Microsoft MCW lab repository should be in `C:\workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-in-azure-devops`. Copy the lab files from the Microsoft MCW lab repository to the new folder.

 ```pwsh
 Copy-Item '..\mcw-continuous-delivery-in-azure-devops\Hands-on lab\lab-files\*' -Destination ./ -Recurse
 ```

- Initialize the `mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files` folder as a git repository, commit, and submit contents to remote GitHub branch `main` in the lab files repository created in Step 1.

 > **Note**: The URI of the lab files GitHub repository created in Step 1 will differ from that in the example below.

 ```pwsh
 git init
 git add .
 git commit -m "Initial commit"
 git branch -M main
 git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files.git
 git push -u origin main
 ```

### Task 2: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Log in to your GitHub account.

2. Create a Personal Access Token as [described here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). Ensure the following scopes are checked when configuring your GitHub Personal Access Token:

    - `repo` - Full control of private repositories.
    - `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows.
    - `write:packages` - Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry.
    - `delete:packages` - Delete packages from GitHub Package Registry.
    - `read:org` - Read org and team membership, read org projects. This is under the `admin:org` section of scopes.

    ![The configured scopes for a GitHub Personal Access Token.](media/b4-task2-step2-1.png "GitHub Personal Access Token Scope Configuration")

3. Copy the GitHub Personal Access Token somewhere safe and accessible for later use during the lab. **DO NOT COMMIT THIS VALUE TO YOUR REPO!**

    ![The GitHub Personal Access Token. This is a secret value that should be stored somewhere safe and accessible.](media/b4-task2-step3-1.png "Created GitHub Personal Access Token")

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
